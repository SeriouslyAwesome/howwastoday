# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# The following keys must be escaped otherwise they will not be retrieved by
# the default I18n backend:
#
# true, false, on, off, yes, no
#
# Instead, surround them with single quotes.
#
# en:
#   'true': 'foo'
#
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# available at http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.

  hello: How was your day today?

      new_heading: How was your day today?
      edit_heading: Need to reevaluate how it went today?
    thanks:
      rating_1_heading: I'm really sorry :(
      rating_1_text: Sounds like a pretty bad day. Just remember that you can't always control what happens to you, but you can control how you respond to it. Tomorrow is another day; set a resolution to make it better than today.

      rating_2_heading: Bummer :(
      rating_2_text: I'm sorry your day didn't go so well. I'm sure tomorrow will be better!

      rating_3_heading: Oh well :|
      rating_3_text: Seems like it was neither here nor there, and that's okay. Could be better, but it could also be worse.

      rating_4_heading: Awesome :)
      rating_4_text: Glad you're having a good day!

      rating_5_heading: Heck yes! :D
      rating_5_text: If only every day could be this good, am I right!?
